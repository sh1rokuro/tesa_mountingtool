Tesa Mounting Tool â€“ Orientation & Motion with BNO055

This project was developed as part of the Cross-Innovation-Class for Tesa. It serves as an interactive guidance system for the precise application of Tesa Powerstrips along a wall. The system detects orientation and motion deviations using the BNO055 sensor and visually indicates them via LEDs.
